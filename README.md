# LoopWorkspace

The Loop app can be built using GitHub workflows in the cloud from a browser on any computer or using a Mac with Xcode.

* Non-developers may prefer the GitHub workflow method, which does not require a mac.
* Developers or Loopers who want full build control may prefer the local Mac/Xcode method.

## GitHub Build Instructions

The GitHub Build Instructions are at this [link](fastlane/testflight.md) and further expanded in [LoopDocs: Browser Build](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/gh-overview/).

## Mac/Xcode Build Instructions

The rest of this README contains information needed for Mac/Xcode build. Additonal instructions are found in [LoopDocs: Mac/Xcode Build](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/build/overview/).

### Clone

This repository uses git submodules to pull in the various workspace dependencies.

To clone this repo:

```
git clone --branch=<branch> --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LoopKit/LoopWorkspace
```

Replace `<branch>` with the initial LoopWorkspace repository branch you wish to checkout.

### Open

Change to the cloned directory and open the workspace in Xcode:

```
cd LoopWorkspace
xed .
```

### Input your development team

You should be able to build to a simulator without changing anything. But if you wish to build to a real device, you'll need a developer account, and you'll need to tell Xcode about your team id, which you can find at https://developer.apple.com/.

In this fork, all targets derive their signing team from the `LOOP_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` build setting — no team ids are hardcoded in the project files. The recommended way to set it is a machine-level override file in your home directory, which git can never clobber or accidentally commit:

```
echo 'LOOP_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = YOURTEAMID' > ~/LoopConfigOverride.xcconfig
```

This works because the tracked `LoopConfigOverride.xcconfig` at the workspace root chains a few optional `#include?` lines that walk up toward your home directory. Xcode resolves those paths relative to the *primary* xcconfig — `Loop/Loop.xcconfig` — not relative to the file doing the including, so each hop is counted from the `Loop/` directory: `../..` reaches the workspace's parent, `../../..` one level above that, and so on. The chain covers clones one to three levels below home, so `~/LoopWorkspace` and `~/projects/LoopWorkspace` both work.

If your clone lives deeper still, add another `../` hop to that chain — but never a bare `../`, which resolves to the workspace-root file itself and self-includes. Alternatively set `LOOP_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` directly in the workspace-root file (upstream's method) — just don't commit your team id.

**Note:** the app's bundle identifier is derived from the team (`com.<TEAM>.loopkit.Loop`), so changing the team id changes the app identity. iOS will treat a build with a different team as a brand-new app — existing settings and pump/CGM pairings from a previous install will not carry over.

### Build

Select the "LoopWorkspace" scheme (not the "Loop" scheme) and Build, Run, or Test. The LoopWorkspace scheme is what builds all of the CGM, pump, and service plugins — building the "Loop" scheme alone produces an app containing only the simulator drivers.

The committed scheme includes an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable that is empty and disabled. If you enable it locally with a real key for debugging (Edit Scheme → Run → Environment Variables), take care not to commit that change.
